/// Represents a Material Design 3 motion token, combining duration and easing.
///
/// This class encapsulates the two core components of an M3 animation:
/// - [duration]: How long the animation runs.
/// - [curve]: The easing curve that defines the rate of change over time.
///
/// See: https://m3.material.io/styles/motion/easing-and-duration/tokens-specs
class MaterialMotionToken {
  /// Creates a motion token with a specific duration and curve.

  /// The total time the animation will take.
  final Duration duration;

  /// The easing curve for the animation.
  final Curve curve;

  /// Creates a [Tween] for this motion token, animating between [begin] and [end].
  ///
  /// This is a convenience method for creating a [CurveTween] that can be
  /// chained with another tween (like [Tween<double>]) and driven by an
  /// [AnimationController].
  ///
  /// Example:
  /// ```dart
  /// myAnimation = controller.drive(MaterialMotion.emphasized.asTween(begin: 0.0, end: 1.0));
  /// ```
  Animatable<T> asTween<T>({required T begin, required T end}) {

/// Defines the standard motion tokens for Material Design 3.
///
/// These tokens provide standardized duration and easing values for creating
/// consistent and natural-feeling animations across the application.
///
/// Instead of using fixed durations, M3 motion is defined by a combination of
/// duration and an easing curve, represented here by the [MaterialMotionToken] class.
